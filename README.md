### 👋 **Hi there! I'm LukeIdowu**

---

### 🧑‍💻 **About Me**  
I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** at **University Of South Wales**. My journey into the world of technology began when I first experimented with programming in my first year of A levels. I vividly remember writing a simple program for a basic calculator in **Visual Basic** — that was when I realized how rewarding it felt to create something functional with just a few lines of code. As I delved deeper, I discovered the vast potential of computer science. Whether it’s solving complex problems, building tools that make life easier, or creating systems that bring people together, I’ve always been inspired by the way technology shapes our world. Today, my interests span across **Web Development**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. I love tackling real-world challenges through code, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies that can expand my capabilities.

- 👤 Customer management (storing customer details, processing sales).  
- 👥 Staff management (tracking staff, managing payroll).  

**Technologies Used**: **Visual Basic**

**Challenges Solved**:
- 🗃️ Designed a database to store car inventory, customer details, and staff information.  
- 🖥️ Implemented effective queries to fetch data for various modules like car stock, payroll, and customer records.  
- 📝 Created user-friendly forms to store, retrieve, and update customer information.  
- 💵 Developed a payroll management system for staff, allowing the calculation of wages based on work hours and bonuses.  
- 🔐 Implemented role-based security to restrict access to sensitive data such as payroll information, ensuring only authorized users can access certain functionalities.  
- 👥 Ensured the system could handle multiple users by developing login authentication mechanisms.
